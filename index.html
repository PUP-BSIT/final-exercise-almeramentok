            In five years, I aspire to be knowledgeable about my passion. 
            Currently, I am uncertain about my ultimate dream, but I envision 
            myself in a happy and comfortable place. I acknowledge that life can
            be challenging, especially in the demanding field of IT where stress
            is prevalent. It might sound humorous, but my ambition is to achieve 
            success as quickly as possible.
          </div>
  
          <div class="journal">
            I aim to nurture my inner child and provide my mother with the 
            fulfilling life she deserves. There is a sense of urgency in my 
            quest, as I regret not being able to offer my father the best life 
            he deserved. Over the past few months, I've faced numerous 
            breakdowns, causing me to question the value of my academic 
            performance. Despite these doubts, I hope that in the upcoming 
            weeks, I can reaffirm my worth in this industry.
          </div>
  
          <div class="journal">
            I want these next few weeks to serve as a renewed motivation to 
            pursue a career in this field. Although I have a desire to be here, 
            I am still uncertain about the specific type of work I want to 
            pursue after graduating.
